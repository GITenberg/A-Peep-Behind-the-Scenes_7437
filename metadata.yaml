description: '"Living in a carnival would be so exciting. All the bright colors and
  fun that go with the fair would be pure joy. At least, that''s what the local children
  thought. But they didn''t know of Rosalie and her family. Mother was sick and father
  wouldn''t take time to think about his family''s needs or wants. Rosalie stays up
  late working very hard with the acting troupe. Life behind the scenes is anything
  but exciting. One day, a stranger gives Rosalie a picture of a shepherd holding
  a lamb. The man tells the young girl and her mother about the Good Shepherd, Jesus
  and how He longs to show His love for them. will Rosalie belief? Can she trust God
  to find a real home?"--Cover verso.'
